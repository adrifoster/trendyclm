We used CLM's N fertilization driver data instead of that supplied by TRENDY because we 
felt it did not mesh well with our crop distributions

We also used CLM's population data, which drives fire ignitions.

Finally, though we were asked to only supply one file per variable, the PFT-specific 
outputs would have been very huge if all the PFTs were on one file, so we supplied them as
one file and one PFT per file. They can be easily combined and merged using a library
like xarray.
