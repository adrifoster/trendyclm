These variables are not applicable to CLM and so are not supplied

albedopft - we do not output 'blue sky albedo', we have instead supplied both black sky and white sky albedo
cSoilpft - soil carbon is not output at the PFT level, as PFTs share a soil column
fGrazing - CLM does not have grazing
fVegSoil - this is not output by CLM
mslpft - soil moisture is not output at the PFT level, as PFTs share a soil column
nbppft - NBP is not calculated at the PFT level
rhpft - RH is not calculated at the PFT level
snow_depthpft - snow depth is not output at the PFT level, as PFTs share a soil column
